##  Criteria Of Computer NEtwork
1. __Performance__:<br/>
This is measured as time taken by data to travel from one source to destination(transit time) and response time( time elapsed by query and response.
2. __Reliability__<br/>
This is how effective network is by measuring failures. 
3. __Security__<br/>
This is how data is protected as it moves though medium from source to destination.

##  COmponents of data communication

2. __Sender__: Computer sending the message.
3. __Receiver__: Computer Receiving the information
